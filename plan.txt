Day 1: 6/22/23
Tasks: 1. Refamiliarize myself with JavaScript. 
       2. Watch some Cypress videos
Accomplished: Accomplished task 2. Didn't really feel like watching JavaScript kinda borba. Cypress looks really cool though. Unfortunatly thats
              all I got from watching a  video and the beggining of a video. Also started the Cypress thing. Need to get it to run properly, will
              see how long that takes.
